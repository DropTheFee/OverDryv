# Project Summary
The OverDryv project is a multi-tenant application aimed at revolutionizing vehicle service management by enabling service providers to efficiently handle customer profiles, estimates, work orders, and invoicing. This platform enhances user experience with a comprehensive dashboard that fosters seamless interactions between service providers and customers. Recent updates have refined the architecture, distinctly separating the root domain from tenant subdomains to offer a customized experience for each user.

# Project Module Description
- **Admin Dashboard**: Central hub for managing customers, vehicles, and work orders.
- **Customer Portal**: Interface for customers to access service history and manage their vehicles.
- **Estimates and Invoices**: Tools for generating and managing service estimates and invoices.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication and profile management.
- **Root Domain Experience**: Acts as a router with email lookup functionality, without authentication.
- **Tenant Subdomain Experience**: Branded login for organizations, where all authentication and app usage occurs.
